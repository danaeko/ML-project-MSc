2. Create PCA, FA and KPCA plots.
3. Tests 6 different classification models with K fold cross validation in order to select the best hyper-parameters for each model

4. With the best models from step 2 runs 2 different algorithms for feature selection

5. Test the performance of each model, using the optimal hyper-parameters and features from step 2 and 3 respectively
