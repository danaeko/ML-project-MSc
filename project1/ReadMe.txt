Run the script script_code.sh

The script performs the following tasks:

  1. Reads the dataset and provides a description of the corresponding data.

  2. Tests six different classification models using K-fold cross-validation to select the best hyperparameters for     each model.

  3. Uses the best models from step 2 to run two different algorithms for feature selection.

  4. Evaluates the performance of each model using the optimal hyperparameters and selected features from steps 2 and   3, respectively.
