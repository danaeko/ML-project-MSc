Run the script 'script_code.sh'

The script does the following


1. Read the dataset and provides a description of the corresponding data

2. Tests 6 different classification models with K fold cross validation in order to select the best hyper-parameters for each model

3. With the best models from step 2 runs 2 different algorithms for feature selection

4. Test the performance of each model, using the optimal hyper-parameters and features from step 2 and 3 respectively
